Welcome to the bathroom Confessional! Here you can express your bodily waste and at the same time alleviate emotional garbage, regrets, guilt and other trapped negativity.  

Your confession will be kept private; your confession is solely between you, this stall and your divinity. On this special seat you can confess any concerning matters great or small.  No confessions will be recorded or monitored â€“ all dialogue is confidential.  

After your confession press the button to receive your penance.  

May you find pardon and peace!
